The project aims to provide a more modern and safe way to interface with the library, while maintaining compatibility with existing code written in **C** and **C++**.


### Q: Does libvlc-zig aim to replace libvlc?


A: No, `libvlc-zig` does not aim to replace libvlc. Instead, it provides an alternative way to interface with the library that may be more suitable for Zig developers.


### Q: Can I use libvlc-zig in my project?
